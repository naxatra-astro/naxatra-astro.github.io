            <p>The cosmos calls upon you! An intergalactic body of scholars has lost an ancient artifact—Darkhold, a book containing the universe's boundless secrets that is now scattered across the galaxy. Its fragmented pages hold secrets waiting to be approached. So, are you ready to join a team of scholars to embark on this quest to find the book?</p>

            <p>Title: Space Weather and its Impact on Planetary Environments and Space Technology</p>
            <p>Abstract- .The Sun is a dynamic star whose magnetism determines its activity. This activity is manifested in variable solar radiation, electromagnetic and particle fluxes, and an omnipresent stream of supersonic plasma flow known as the solar wind that permeates interplanetary space. All of these phenomena together influence habitability—or the possibility of a planet to host life within a harsh and changing astrophysical ecosystem. When the Sun is very active, it also spawns violent magnetic storms such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections that perturb the near-Earth space environment, affecting satellite operations, telecommunication and navigational networks, air traffic over polar routes, electric power grids, and oil pipe lines. In this talk, I shall discuss the origin of space weather and describe our research to predict its impacts on space-reliant technologies that drive modern societies.</p>

            <p>Title: Search for Extraterrestrial Life.</p>
            <p>Abstract- The search for extraterrestrial life is one of the most irresistible and profound scientific endeavours of modern-day astronomy and planetary sciences, aiming to answer the eternal question: Are we alone in the universe? Our universe is molecular at its core, with the building blocks of life—such as amino acids, nucleotides, and simple organic molecules— found across a wide range of astrophysical environments, from star- forming regions to comets and meteorites. These molecules suggest that building block molecules can be easily synthesised elsewhere and shed. light on the mechanisms that may have led to the origin of these molecules in the context of life on Earth. Theories such as abiogenesis propose that life could have arisen from simple molecules under specific conditions, and three essential ingredients that need to be synthesised first are believed to be RNA/DNA, proteins and cell walls. Several processes are conjectured for the formation of these vital ingredients. When the question of the probability of finding life elsewhere comes, the Drake equation is used to assess planets with life, which estimates the number of civilisations capable of interstellar communication in our galaxy. This equation emphasises the numerous factors involved in the likelihood of detecting alien life, from the number of stars with habitable planets to the lifespan of technologically advanced civilisations. A historic milestone in the search for intelligent life came with the Arecibo message -a binaryencoded message sent into space in 1974 to reach potential extraterrestrial civilisations. While we have yet to detect any response, the Arecibo message symbolised humanity's first attempt to reach beyond our planet. As technological advances continue, the quest to find life and. perhaps even reach another habitable world grows more apparent. The discovery of exoplanets in habitable zones around stars offers new. possibilities for future exploration and the detection of biosignatures that may signal the presence of Life. My talk will explore these key points in the. search for extraterrestrial life, highlighting the molecular foundation of life, the possible mechanisms behind its origin, and our attempt to find them.</p>
